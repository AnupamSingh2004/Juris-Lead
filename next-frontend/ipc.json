The provided document has section 462 relating to 'Punishment for same offence when committed by person entrusted with custody' in the context of breaking open a receptacle, but the text provided appears to be a mix of sections 461 and 462. Section 462 specifically increases the punishment of the offence in 461 if committed by a person entrusted with custody]. The actual text for 462 is not clearly provided in the document. A general description is: Whoever, being entrusted with any closed receptacle which contains or which he believes to contain property, commits the offence defined in the last preceding section (461), shall be punished with imprisonment... which may extend to three years...",
